# Three-Tier Architecture with Docker Compose

This repository demonstrates a simple three-tier architecture using Docker Compose. The architecture includes the following tiers:

1. **Frontend**: A web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) serving static files or acting as a reverse proxy.
2. **Backend**: An application server (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js) handling business logic.
3. **Database**: A database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for data storage.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Docker: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
